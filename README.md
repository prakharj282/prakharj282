Hello GitHub World

Hi! I'm a student learning software development and building my skills in Git, GitHub, and modern coding tools. I'm especially interested in understanding how real-world teams collaborate using version control and proper development workflows. I'm excited to keep improving and building projects that solve meaningful problems.
